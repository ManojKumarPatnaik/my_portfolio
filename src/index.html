                  Library Management System Using Microservices Architecture</h3>
                <div>
                  <p class="mb-4">
                    As a developer, I have developed one Library Management System using Microservices architecture. The system consists of three separate services: User, Book, and Library service, each with basic functionalities like Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.

                    To ensure seamless communication between the services, we used Eureka discovery server for service discovery and Cloud Gateway as the gateway itself.

                    I have implemented Open Feign for intercommunication between services and a client-side load balancer for optimal performance. The system also includes unit tests for service and controller layers, and uses MySQL database for data storage.

                    Our Library Management System uses both JWT and OAuth Spring Security to ensure secure access to the system.

                    To ensure the quality of our code, we wrote unit tests for service and controller layers, and used MySQL database for data storage. We used a range of tools and technologies, including Spring Boot, Spring Rest, Spring Cloud OpenFeign, IntelliJ, Spring Cloud Load balancer, Cloud Gateway, Mockito, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security, PostMan, Sonar, and STS.

                    Overall, the Library Management System is a highly scalable and efficient tool that showcases our expertise in developing microservices using the Spring Boot framework and Spring Cloud ecosystem. With its seamless communication between services and optimal performance, the system is a testament to our commitment to using the latest technologies and best practices in software development.

                  Password Management Tool</h3>
                <div>
                  <p class="mb-4">
                    As a developer, I have developed one of the Password Management Tool (PMT) application that allows users to store multiple account details along with an encrypted password.

                    The development of the PMT application was an iterative process, starting with the console for input and Collections framework as the backend, and progressing to MySQL database and Hibernate ORM for CRUD operations. We then shifted to Spring Core for dependency injection, and replaced the DAO layer implementation using Hibernate with Spring Data JPA. We used Spring MVC with JSP for presentation, and ultimately migrated to Spring Boot for creating REST APIs.

                    The PMT application is a highly secure and scalable tool that supports various interfaces like web, smart devices, browser plugins, and application plugins. It allows users to generate random secure passwords with user-defined character sets and lengths, view saved passwords securely, group password accounts, and perform CRUD operations on password accounts and groups.

                    Throughout the development process, we used a variety of tools and technologies, including Postman, IntelliJ Idea, Eclipse, STS, Sonar Lint, Git, Spring Boot, Maven, Spring Security, and various frameworks such as Spring, Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA, Spring Rest, JPA/Hibernate, JSP, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Lombok, Data Validation, JUnit, and Mockito.

                    PMT application offers a range of features to help users manage their passwords securely and efficiently. These features include generating random secure passwords, grouping password accounts, creating and reading passwords for specific accounts, and modifying or deleting password accounts and groups. With PMT, users can easily organize and access their passwords, ensuring that their sensitive information is always protected.

                    Overall, the PMT application is a powerful and secure tool that showcases our expertise in software development and our commitment to using the latest technologies and best practices.
